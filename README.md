## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I learned some classes for TailwindCSS and how to use them in my HTML structure.

```html
<div class="grid grid-rows-1 grid-cols-3 gap-2 pt-4"></div>
```
```css
#content button:first-child{
    background-color: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
    box-shadow: 0 10px 10px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0,0.2);
}
```


### Continued development

I'll try to solve more Frontend Mentor challenges in order to use technologies I'm learning and improve my skills.
